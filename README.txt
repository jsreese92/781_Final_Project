Required Libraries:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib

Executing code:
  Executing Main.py will display a graph of paths reachable for a robot with
  parameters specified via PointRobot()

  The top commented-out code is what I used to do run-time analysis, it just
  executes the algorithm without plotting the results. 

  Some of the lower commented-out code is testing for dijsktra's algorithm,
  which takes too long to run if you just want to see the plot.

Please let me know if you have any problems running my code!
